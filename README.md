## Operational data collector

Since I worked over 10 years in the food industry, I've seen the high potential of implementing tech tools like light-weight apps (web/mobile)
on the shopfloor-level (production-site).


### Purpose of ODC

Collecting data from the shopfloor. Adding production-operation relevant information as fast as possible.

### Stack
reactjs / typescript frontend
spring-boot (jpa, web) backend

### Upcoming plans
- webflux
- api for ERPs (service)
- messaging (kafka vs rabbitmq)
- nosql db (mongodb)
- production planning feature (service)
- microservice ecosystem
- cloud ready
- handhelds 

### Why? 
As a pet project, I wanted to build a growing diverse ecosystem of services and technologies, which will help
to solve a real-life problem of a medium-sized company.
And learn a ton... and have a sh.. load of fun.
